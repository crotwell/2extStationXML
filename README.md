# 2extStationXML
code to help translate StationXML from IRIS DMC into ExtendedStationXML for ingestion into SIS

See the [wiki](https://github.com/crotwell/2extStationXML/wiki) for what little documentation exists.

**Warning:** IRIS is transitioning from the old svn and file based NRL to a new NRL web service. This change is substantial and the current code will not work with the new NRL. At this point, due to lack of time and demand, I do not expect to update this to be compatible with the new NRL web service. 
It may be possible to continue to use this with a local archived copy of the old NRL or by disabling the NRL feature in this tool and letting all responses  be treated as custom responses.
